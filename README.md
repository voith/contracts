## What is TCAP?

TCAP is the World's First Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Token created by Cryptex Finance. Like a conventional index fund, TCAP gives holders a real-time price exposure to the total cryptocurrency market cap. It's a 150% fully collateralized asset thatâ€™s both audited and accurately representative of the entire cryptocurrency complex by total market capitalization.

TCAPs are then minted upon being collateralized by an underlying asset, such as ETH, WBTC or DAI. The TCAP smart contracts are powered by Chainlink decentralized oracles that blend real time total market cap crypto data from seven of the most reputable crypto data providers in the world, subsequently bringing said data on chain to our TCAP smart contract.
